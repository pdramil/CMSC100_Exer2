Steps to create a GitHub page:
    1. Navigate to the site's repository.
    2. Under the repository name, click 'Settings', then select 'Pages' from the sidebar.
    3. On the 'Build and Deployment' section, click the dropdown menu from 'Branch', then choose 'main' and 'Save'.
    4. Go back to the 'Code' page of the repository and find the link to the website found in the 'Deployments' section on the bottom-right.

My key takeaways from this exercise include:
    1. creating a website is challenging yet fun;
    2. GitHub Pages provides an easy way to deploy a website fast and free.
